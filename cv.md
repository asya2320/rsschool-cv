## About me and my life
I am glad to see you on my first CV page! I was born in Yaroslavl, Russia. Now I am getting a higher education in St. Petersburg. I graduated with honors from art school and still adore art as much as I love working with code. Bernard Shaw's quote has always inspired me to overcome new difficulties
>Work hard to get what you like, otherwise you'll be forced to just like what you get.

## Code Example
This is the first code I wrote on the codevars website. My function returns the largest and smallest numbers from the string.
```
function highAndLow(numbers){
    let arr = numbers.split(' ');
    let arrV = new Array;
    for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
      arrV[i]=+arr[i];
    }
    min=Math.min.apply(null, arrV);
    max=Math.max.apply(null, arrV);
    return (max+' '+min);
  }
```
